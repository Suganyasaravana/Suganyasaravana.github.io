  <h1>Swacch Bharat</h1> 
  <p><font size="5">Two years ago,when Swacch barath Abhiyan was launched we all where
   really excited and  there were several events to clean up our cities.However,the yawning
   gap between the enthusiam to clean up the city and not knowing how to go about it has led 
  us back to square one.</p>
<p>It is not only the governments responsibility.We people should use dustbin. 
its our duty to make our city clean and green.Government can only provide dustbins we should use it 
in a right way.Cultivate the habit of putting dusts in dustbins,make sure that you put degradeable and non-degradeable
wastes in separate trashcan allocated.</p>
<p>JOIN YOUR HANDS TO MAKE OUR CITY CLEAN;MAKE USE OF DUSTBINS</p>
